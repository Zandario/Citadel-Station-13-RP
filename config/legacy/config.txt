## Server name: This appears at the top of the screen in-game. In this case it will read "tgstation: station_name" where station_name is the randomly generated name of the station for the round. Remove the # infront of SERVERNAME and replace 'tgstation' with the name of your choice
# SERVERNAME Citadel Station 13 RP

## Alert levels
ALERT_GREEN All threats to the station have passed. Security may not have weapons visible, privacy laws are once again fully enforced.
ALERT_BLUE_UPTO The station has received reliable information about possible hostile activity on the station. Security staff may have weapons visible, random searches are permitted.
ALERT_BLUE_DOWNTO The immediate threat has passed. Security may no longer have weapons drawn at all times, but may continue to have them visible. Random searches are still allowed.
ALERT_RED_UPTO There is an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times. Random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_RED_DOWNTO The station is no longer under threat of imminent destruction, but there is still an immediate serious threat to the station. Security may have weapons unholstered at all times, random searches are allowed and advised.
ALERT_DELTA The station is under immediate threat of imminent destruction! All crew are instructed to obey all instructions given by heads of staff. Any violations of these orders can result up to and including termination. This is not a drill.

## Overrides for required number of readied up players for a gamemode to be able to start can be defined here.
## If it is unset, it will default to the requirement set by the gamemode datum.
## Note that this does not control the required amount of antags for a gamemode, and so a lower number may still fail to start if not enough people want to be antags.
## By default, this overrides the voted gamemode requirement. To override the requirement for Secret, append '_SECRET' to the end of the first word.
## The format to use is REQUIRED_PLAYERS[_SECRET] [gamemode tag] [number of readies needed], for example, "REQUIRED_PLAYERS TRAITOR 1", or "REQUIRED_PLAYERS_SECRET MERCENARY 10".
